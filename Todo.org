* osc-spec mode
** Initialize the spec
When initializing the spec make sure to follow [[http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines#Metadata_Tags][Metadata Tags]]

 
*** TODO Initialize the spec file if it does not exist
    [ ] Using skeleton, tempo or auto-insert create a default spec file see the
    [[file:osc-spec-mode.el::%3B%3B%20TODO%20use%20auto-insert%20mode%20to%20initiliaze%20the%20spec][todo in the osc-spec-mode]] reading the auto-insert from emacs manual should
    help best options and the way to go.

    [ ] if possible create spec template for major packages as outlined in 
   [[ http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines][openSUSE Specfile Guidelines]]
*** TODO spec License
    [ ] create a license for the spec file itself as below using package name default for spec file 
      with current year and either get osc user full name and email or make it as an option
      to configure. By default it should be set to user name and email address as
      emacs sees it.

       #+begin_example
       # spec file for package python-$FOO
       #
       # Copyright (c) $CURRENT_YEAR $YOUR_NAME_WITH_MAIL_ADDRESS
       #
       # All modifications and additions to the file contributed by third parties
       # remain the property of their copyright owners, unless otherwise agreed
       # upon. The license for this file, and modifications and additions to the
       # file, is the same license as for the pristine package itself (unless the
       # license for the pristine package is not an Open Source License, in which
       # case the license is the MIT License). An "Open Source License" is a
       # license that conforms to the Open Source Definition (Version 1.9)
       # published by the Open Source Initiative.
  
       # Please submit bugfixes or comments via http://bugs.opensuse.org/
       #+end_example
** TODO Editing and fixing the spec file
Even though the spec template should provide the basics of setup build install
and files parts, it may be needed (as is the case usually) to modify various
parts of the spec file. There should be functions that would allow to do so as
we might be editing a spec file anyway.

*** TODO package license
    [ ] should meet [[http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_guidelines#Licensing][openSUSE Packaging license]]

*** TODO Build Requires
    [ ] If there are multiple BuildRequires then fix them so there is one per
    line.
*** TODO patches
    [ ] when adding patches make sure to follow [[http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Patches_guidelines][openSUSE Patching Guidelines]]
    [ ] find the patches in the current directory and add them to the spec file
    with the correct patch number
    [ ] find rejects when the patch is applied and view  them side by side

*** TODO rpm tags and groups list
    [ ] Use rpm groups  Also add openSUSE related macros to rpm-tags-list look at
    build/parsePreamble.c:preambleList[] 
*** TODO Create or move changelog
    [ ] openSUSE uses packagename.changes file so do I need this part
     actually. The answer is no. However, I need to make sure osc vc or a similar
     action is done and if possible create such a thing.
    [ ] if the spec file already has the changelog entries then need to
    correct the part so there is a PACKAGENAME.changes file.
